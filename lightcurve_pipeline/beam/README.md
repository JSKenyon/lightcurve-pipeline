# MeerKAT Primary Beams

Primary beam models live here. 

The recipe will automatically download ``MeerKAT_L_band_primary_beam.npz`` and ``MeerKAT_L_band_primary_beam.npz`` from https://archive-gw-1.kat.ac.za/public/repository/10.48479/wdb0-h061/index.html, if they are not already present.

If you already have a copy of the above files locally, you can save the download time by copying or symlinking them in here.
